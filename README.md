# Colour Swatches

A small Angular app designed to display colour swatches nicely.


## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Change the branding in the footer to your own
3. Add colours in the `main.js` file:

```js
$scope.colours = [
  { name: 'orange', code: 'ffa629' },
  { name: 'green', code: '2fff83' },
  { name: 'raspberry', code: 'fb006f' }
];
```
